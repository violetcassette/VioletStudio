# Roadmap
Please note that "fully working" only means "all important features implemented". Bugs are likely to appear at any time, and I don't want to burden the project by refusing to move to next milestone, especially when more bugs will be introduced as a result of the new implementations. Also, "by this stage" means "by the introduction of this milestone". For example, Animated screenbugs should be working by the time we ENTER the alpha stage of development.

### CONCEPT
- [ ] Likely consisting of nonfunctional output, but with progress made on implementing configuration menus

### PRE-ALPHA
- [ ] Run VioletStudio executable in foreground for configuration purposes, with OBS running in the background until called for broadcast (this could potentially become integrated within the OBS UI, but I am uncertain of this)
- [ ] Progress gets made on referring to files and having them play back
- [ ] Begin progress on automated programming "scheduling" (really just shuffling)

### ALPHA
- [ ] OBS previews get integrated into the configuration menu for ease of access
- [ ] Begin progress on customizable, yet automated scheduling using user-set parameters based on time, content rating, and programming
- [ ] Begin implementation of emergency broadcasting relays (external endecs are a priority)
- [ ] Begin implementation of the internal character generator
- [ ] Implement universal safe area guides
- [ ] Begin implementation of country-based broadcasting guidelines
- [ ] Begin implementation of remote logging options
- [ ] Begin implementation of live programming options (programming which is not pre-recorded, such as a WeatherStar 4000)
- [ ] Begin implementation of interstitial content management (with verbose schedule views showing where it resides)
- [ ] Animated screenbugs and rating bugs should be mostly working by this stage
- [ ] Single-feed video output should be fully working by this stage

### BETA
- [ ] Begin implementation of software-based EAS encoders
- [ ] Begin implementation of Alert Ready relays
- [ ] Begin implementation of external TTS engines for EAS encoding (such as SAPI 4.0 and DECTalk)
- [ ] Begin implementation of remote WebUI
- [ ] Potential implementation of CAP/IPAWS?
- [ ] Potentially implement an interface between VioletStudio and VirtualBox for automated TTS script editing and playback during fully software-based solutions
- [ ] Implement migration of VioletStudio networks and configuration to different operating
- [ ] Emphasize localization in this stage
- [ ] Open community featue requests
- [ ] Configurations should be stable by this stage
- [ ] Remote logging should be fully working by this stage
- [ ] Multi-feed video output should definitely be working by this stage
- [ ] Scheduling should be fully working by this stage

### RELEASE CANDIDATES
- [ ] All features conceptuialized at the start of the project should be implemented whenever possible
- [ ] Little to no new features should be introduced during this stage unless they are made cruical to the stability of the project
- [ ] Most showstopping bugs should be cleared by this stage, but they can't be ruled out

### FIRST RELEASE
- [ ] Most major and minor bugs should concievably be gone, but the possibility of releasing hotfixes should not be ruled out

### BEYOND
- [ ] Focus on bugfixes, advancements in the ease of implementation, stability, and community-requested features
